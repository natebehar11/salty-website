      { question: 'What airport do I fly into for the Sri Lanka retreat?', answer: 'Fly into Bandaranaike International Airport (CMB) in Colombo. We pick you up there. The drive south to Ahangama takes approximately 3 hours along the scenic coastal highway.' },
      { question: 'Do I need a visa to visit Sri Lanka?', answer: 'Yes. Most nationalities need an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) which you can apply for online. It costs about $50 USD and is approved within 24 hours. We\'ll send you the link and instructions after booking.' },
      { question: 'What skill level do I need for surfing?', answer: 'Any level works. Most guests have never surfed before arriving. The instructors in Ahangama are experienced with complete beginners. Intermediate surfers get guided to better breaks along the coast.' },
      { question: 'Is Sri Lanka safe for solo travelers?', answer: 'Yes. Sri Lanka is one of the safest countries in South Asia for travelers. The southern coast is well-traveled and tourist-friendly. Plus, you\'re with a group of 25-35 people and our local team knows the area inside and out.' },
      { question: 'How does the two-location thing work?', answer: 'You spend your first 6 nights in Ahangama on the coast, then travel inland by scenic train to Ella in the mountains for the final 3 nights. All logistics and transfers are handled by us. You just show up with your bag.' },
      { question: 'What\'s the weather like in February?', answer: 'February is dry season on the south coast. Expect 28-32\u00B0C (82-90\u00B0F), sunny mornings, and occasional afternoon showers that clear quickly. Ella is cooler in the mountains (20-25\u00B0C) with misty mornings.' },
      { question: 'What if I don\'t want to do an activity?', answer: 'Everything is optional. Want to skip morning surf for sleep? Do it. Prefer the pool to the hike? Fine. We\'re not tracking attendance. This is your retreat.' },
      { question: 'Can I extend my trip before or after?', answer: 'Yes. Many guests add time in Colombo, head to the east coast, or continue to the Maldives (short flight away). We can recommend logistics and accommodations.' },
      { question: 'What about dietary restrictions?', answer: 'We accommodate vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and most common allergies. Sri Lankan cuisine is naturally diverse with plenty of options. Let us know when you book and we handle the rest.' },
      { question: 'How many people will be on the retreat?', answer: 'Sri Lanka hosts 25-35 guests. Big enough to find your people, small enough that everyone knows each other\'s names by day three.' },
      { question: 'Do I need to be in good shape?', answer: 'No. Surfing is about timing, not strength. Yoga is all levels. The hikes in Ella are moderate (1-2 hours). If you can walk uphill and swim, you\'re qualified.' },
